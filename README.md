### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
##### I'm KminuShin, just call me Shin. I'm interested in home automation, and I want to make a series of products using arduino, esp, raspberry pi, and connect them to a home server, and this is why I'm here. I want to learn more about networking, so I can make my ideas come true!
